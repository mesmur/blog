In terms of categories, I'm thinking of dividing my technical writings as:

1. Dev Blogs (reflections on projects I am (or want to lol) work on)
2. Learnings (the topics I've learned or am learning about, geared towards conceptual topics baked in with practical
   examples)
3. Insights (the topics I've reflected on, or dived into, and modeled some thoughts around, geared towards more
   practical/specific topics)
4. How-To's (practical shit I had trouble figuring out, hopefully it'll help some weary wandering developer out)
