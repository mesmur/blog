## Life

It's been a hot second since my last status update. Well, that isn't really much of a concern, the purpose of these
updates are to reflect on life as it happens (and as I have time to write about those reflections) - which is a pretty
unstructured process in itself. I mean, I could tell myself I'd do this on a fixed schedule, but I'm afraid that things
will end up becoming a little too formulaic over time.

So, yeah I somehow rationalized my own flaky commitment to writing as a kind of intentioned choice.

Ha.

I'm in a decent place right now. Life is a bit tumultuous (for work reasons I'll get to in a moment) but my perpetual
feelings of purposelessness are starting to die down, bit by bit. Or, maybe they're still around, but I've gotten
content with being lost in life.

I've picked up cooking. It's pretty funny given that cooking was my first "New Year's resolution" for the past year. I
quite vividly remember waking up on January 1st, putting together a grocery list, getting all my ingredients, and then
promptly setting my oven on fire because of a minor gas leak (just a bit of lore).

I want to have fun with it (cooking dishes I love, taking on some of my Mom's recipes) but
also take it seriously to an extent (intentionally learn and practice some cooking fundamentals).

My first major 'meal' was making some chicken curry and some dhal curry a few days ago. It was fantastic, although I'll
likely have to keep on redoing it till I get it tasting like how my mom does it.

On a tangent, I'm still not certain how I want to handle images/media files on this blog *but* please do except some
photos in the future! I'm not all that good at photography, so I can't say how appetizing things will look though.

## Work

A bit of a transition as organizational ownership of my team / project gets shuffled around a bit. Not the worst thing
in the world, but a lot more meetings these days as we try to figure out what's next. It's to be expected though~

## Entertainment

Let me just rave about Arcane for a bit. Season 2 was absolutely *phenomenal!* It wasn't perfect by a long shot, pacing
issues, some odd characterization, and conflict with established lore (RIP OG Viktor) really hurt the overall
progression of the show.

**But** one of my metrics for rating a show is through the emotional highs associated with various story beats. On that
note, both Episode 6 and Episode 7 were off the charts.

Yes I would have liked to spend more time watching Jinx and Vi reconcile over Vander Warwick. Yes the choice to spend
an entire episode on Ekko shenanigans in an alternate timeline was definitely a choice of all time.

But I'd be a dirty little liar if I told you I didn't tear up (a lot) seeing Vander WW losing his sanity once more and
hurting the girls. Or seeing Ekko and Powder dancing
as ["Ma Meillure Ennemie"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F3OGIFnW1k) played (absolute banger of a song by the
way, I haven't been able to stop listening to it!)

So yeah. Emotional highs.

I likely won't remember some of my qualms with Season 2 in a few months. Hell, I don't know if I'm inclined to even
re-watch Arcane as a whole. But man, will I remember those highs *in an instant* as someone mentions the show, or I
hear the soundtrack playing.

*Peak*.

## Health

I'm... pretty alright I suppose. My break from calisthenics has continued, but for the most part because I'm not sure
where I want to slot it in (in terms of schedule). I've had good success in picking up the jump-rope! I'm fairly
consistent with it doing it 4-5x a week (and I can now maintain a 3-2 work-rest ratio for ~25 minutes, on a weighted
rope). I'm enjoying the balance between full-body exercise and cardio at the moment. I got myself a regular jump-rope
too, but I'm not as keen on it aside from all the other cool 'movements' that I could unlock.

On that note, "Rope Flow" showed up on my feed somewhere, and I'm fairly interested in trying it out. Although, it seems
like I'll need a different rope for it, and perhaps a bit more open space. *Phew*, I'll get there I suppose.

## Wrapping Up

That's me at the moment. Figuring out my time outside of work, trying to stay healthy, and muster up the discipline to
keep at it ;)
