## Life

I just turned 26!

It's a somber thought. Really. Since... forever I've taken life as it comes and haven't really thought about some
long-term vision or grand plan that I must carry out. I can't help but feel like I could have done more. Although,
that sentiment is likely to always be there.

I've had no deep insightful reflection since I woke up this morning having lived through another year around the sun. I
have not the faintest clue of what the future holds for me, and while I'm terribly afraid of being so unprepared, I'm
at peace knowing that I'll figure it out.

_Here's to another year of taking life one page at a time._

## Work

Whew, going live with a new customer is always a scary thing. It's been quite hectic keeping things together, but I'll
stay afloat as I always do. It'll be nice to move on to newer (and hopefully more interesting) things soon~

## Books

Still making my way through the [Dandelion Dynasty](https://www.goodreads.com/series/117103-the-dandelion-dynasty)
series. Now on Book 3, and while there's a lot of world-building, the fact that we've 'moved on' to a different set of
characters meant that my interest in the novels waned a bit. I'm still keeping at it though!

I finished [Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26312997-peak) and
while there were some useful nuggets of information - the whole book could have been a fifth as long as it actually was.
It's one of those books you should read once for the insights, then, as long as you can put those insights into practice
you likely won't find yourself coming back for the prose.

## Entertainment

### Anime

FALL SEASON BEGINS SOON AND I CANNOT WAIT. RE-ZERO, DANDADAN, BLUE LOCK, BLEACH, SHANGRI LA FRONTIER.

Alright, I'll stop with the all-caps, but it's a fantastic season for anime fans~

### TV Series

On to the last season of Utopia! I'll be sad when the show ends... I've also just finished
watching [Kaos](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8550732/), it was a solid 7/10 show â€“ although I feel like a lot of its
potential would really only manifest in a second season. Here's to hoping it's not sent to the Netflix shadow realm.

### Video Games

Ever since my encounter with [Furi](https://store.steampowered.com/app/423230/Furi/) I've been absolutely smitten with
high-octane boss-rush type games. I found [Nano
Apostle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400640/NanoApostle/) recently, and I've been having a blast getting through
one boss at a time. Gosh am I garbage though.

The League of Legends World Championship (aptly called "Worlds") should be starting up rather soon so I'll have my eye
on that :D

## A History

This is perhaps a desecration of what the `Now` page is meant to signify, but I couldn't help but feel like I needed to
keep 'track' of what these pages used to be. Yes this blog is version-controlled, but I don't want to be navigating a
git history haha. In case you're interested in past versions of this page head on over
to [the history page](/now/history/).
