## Life

Things are rather vanilla at the moment with most of my focus being on work.

Although I _really_ want that to change, so I'm trying to spend more time on other things.

## Writing

I'm currently working on a series of essays titled: `Making Sense of Idempotency`.

Given that I've just started this blog, I'm also planning on cleaning up and slowly moving over
my [substack](https://maahir.substack.com/) posts over!

## Developing

Working on [Fixed Term Track](https://github.com/mesmur/fixed-term-track-web-server), but honestly having trouble
staying motivated. The project itself isn't... as interesting as I would have thought it would be. I'm likely going to
clean things up a bit and then maybe look for something more interesting to work on.

## Reading

[The Wall of Storms](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18952381-the-wall-of-storms) by Ken Liu!

It's the second book in the [Dandelion Dynasty](https://www.goodreads.com/series/117103-the-dandelion-dynasty) series.
The first book, [The Grace of Kings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18952341-the-grace-of-kings) started off quite
slow but was a fantastic read. No spoilers here haha. I did find the narrative style of the book to be quite unique ,
and whereas it was a little dry at first, things picked up _very_ quickly and I devoured the latter half of the
book.

As for non-fiction, I just
finished [How to Live on 24 Hours a Day](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4855.How_to_Live_on_24_Hours_a_Day) and
while it was a short read, some of the insights were... insightful? Ha, I'll be trying to incorporate some of the
suggestions.

I've started
reading [Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26312997-peak) by K.
Anders Ericsson. There's honestly a lot of fluff, so I find myself skimming through quite a few pages.

As for technical works, I'm going
through [Building Microservices](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22512931-building-microservices). While
microservices is the architectural 'style' of my current job, I've taken the whole concept for granted, and I've been
thinking to work through some foundations. The going is slow but interesting.

## Watching

This season of anime is quite alright, I'm
watching [Wistoria: Wand and Sword](https://myanimelist.net/anime/58059/Tsue_to_Tsurugi_no_Wistoria) and the second
season of [Oshi no Ko](https://myanimelist.net/anime/55791/Oshi_no_Ko_2nd_Season).
Started watching the second season of [Tower of God](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52635/Kami_no_Tou__Ouji_no_Kikan)
, but it's so a let-down compared to the original webtoon, even the first season. Given what a major part of my
childhood ToG was, I'd rather not sully it with this adaptation.

I've been watching episodes of [Utopia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3163562/) while having lunch and dinner. An
absolutely hilarious show. Found it scrolling through youtube shorts and here I am 3 weeks in, 3 seasons down. Yes, not
the fastest of binges, but I don't watch a lot of shows and this has got me gripped! It's also a depressing exhibit of
the absurdities of corporate life. I hope that is something I'll never have to experience... Stay strong
Tony and Nat!

## Playing

[League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/)... haha I've been playing since college and don't find myself with
the energy for anything else at the moment @_@
