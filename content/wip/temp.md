Here's a sort of reflection on Peak.

Deliberate Practice

Mental Representations

## Tangent: What *Is* This?

I read quite a bit. Especially books of the 'productivity' or 'self-help' genres. I find myself fascinated with the
idea of constant improvement and I think books (and podcasts) are my go-to's for that sort of content.

The problem however, is that while I might take *some* notes, it's usually just a couple of bullet points summarizing my
thoughts. It's done as an incremental act and by the time I'm done reading the book I don't really have a desire to go
back and develop some cohesive plan of action on what I've learned.

It doesn't help that a lot of these books are a lot longer than they should be, and making my way through those lulls in
content kill my interest.

So yeah. This series is me *deliberately* reflecting on the things I've read. The process is meant to force me to
revisit my notes. To extract, condense, and link ideas into something I can put into practice, or at the very least,
feel good having read.

Not to be reductive, but while the book is pretty decent and chock-full of nuggets of wisdom and interesting anecdotes –
on a conceptual level there are only two things that are worth understanding, and consequently 'planning' around.

Those two things are:

- Deliberate Practice
- Mental Representations

To start with, we should probably define what these two things are. Then figure out how to apply them in our lives. I'm
going to glaze over the "why" are they important – really you should be reading the book for that.
