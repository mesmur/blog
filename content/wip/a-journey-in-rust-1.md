## Why Even!?

Honestly, I have no idea how I'd document a learning journey like this. One way to consider this is to think of it in
terms of 'Goals' I suppose. There is merit in reflections like this one, and I want to make those clear so I can stay
true to the spirit of what I'm attempting to do.

1. **Reflect on the interesting bits!** *and* more so the bits that you hate. After all, figuring out what isn't working
   for you is as important to tailoring a learning experience as figuring out the things that do work.
2. **Document those activities where you made some kind of breakthrough.** You'll hopefully be doing a lot more than
   just reading a tutorial end-to-end, and whether that's a guided project, or some random side-project you felt like
   you needed to work on, write a bit about your thought process.
3. **Connect**. The things you're learning to the things you've learned. You're a node/typescript one-trick - but you do
   remember parts of C from your Uni days so try to bring it all together.

## Getting Started

As any sane person would, I began my journey on the appropriate subreddit for any new venture being undertaken, this
time [r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/). I searched for a couple of "Where do I get started with Rust?" posts
which, for the most part I distilled into a few resources.

- The official ['Rust Book'](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) for practice
  and [Code Crafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/tracks/rust) for more hands-on experience
- And... a number of books like [Rust in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action)
  and [Zero to Production in Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html)

I was wary of the [thought trap](/muse/2024/thought-movement-action/) so resolved to find more engaging resources to
learn with.

I settled on an 'enhanced' version of the Rust Book by Brown University, [here](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) which
came with quiz material built in, and some enhancements to the original material. On top of that I resolved to complete
the Rustlings challenges associated with each section of the book.

For whatever reason, it seems building CLIs seem to be one of the more popular ways to get started with actually
building something in Rust so I also just let that cook for a bit (more on that later hah)

## Progress

I started this journey towards the tail end of November but didn't really resolve to writing about it till... well the
last week or so. Fear not! Consistency is my kryptonite and while I've made some progress, it's been here and there.

To date I have:

1. Finished reading chapters 1 through 4 of [*The Book*](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/)
2. Completed exercises 1 through 4 of [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
3. Attempted to make a simple CLI to record the contents of my clipboard into [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) and
   return a shareable URL. [^1]

[^1]: My God is the Pastebin API so unfun to work with.

-- For this post I plan to publish it this week
-- The goal is to reflect a bit about where I am right now and how I got there
-- But also - since I've accomplished so little in this time, to a) be consistent in my learning and b) set future goals
-- I suppose one way of thinking about this is to
